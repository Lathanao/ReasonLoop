### IMPROVEMENT INTEGRATION: FAILURE-RESISTANT AGENTIC ARCHITECTURE

**Key Upgrades from v1:**
1. Built-in failure anticipation matrices
2. Dynamic criteria weight adjustment
3. Domain-specific credibility scoring
4. Self-audit protocols
5. Experience-based recovery patterns

## ENHANCED ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Industry Analysis Additions
- **Failure Landscape**: Common error types (e.g., healthcare: "outdated trial data")
- **Credibility Signals**: Industry-specific trust markers (e.g., finance: SEC-compliant sources)
- **Recovery Protocols**: Domain-approved fallbacks (e.g., manufacturing: ISO-standard alternatives)

### Cognitive Architecture Requirements
- **Pre-Task Simulation**: Test 3 probable failure scenarios
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Auto-adjust decision criteria based on data quality
- **Post-Task Autopsy**: Compare results against historical performance

## UPGRADED AGENT DEFINITION COMPONENTS

### 3. DECISION CRITERIA (ENHANCED)
```yaml
decision_matrix:
  - criteria: cost_effectiveness
    weight: 40%
    validation: "Cross-check with {industry}_benchmarks.md"
    failure_response: "If variance >20%, trigger human review"
```

### 4. VALIDATION RULES (CONTEXT-AWARE)
```yaml
validation:
  - "Verify source credibility using {industry}_trustlist.yaml"
  - "Reject recommendations with ambiguity_score >25%"
  - "Confirm compliance with {industry}_ethics_charter.md"
```

### 5. FALLBACK MECHANISMS (FAILURE-DRIVEN)
```yaml
fallback:
  - scenario: "Data conflict"
    response: "Activate 3-point verification protocol"
  - scenario: "Time overflow"
    response: "Deliver phased outputs every 15m"
```

### 6. OUTPUT FORMAT (DIAGNOSTIC-READY)
```yaml
## Expected Output Structure
1. Primary Recommendation
2. Confidence Score (1-10 scale)
3. Potential Failure Flags
4. Alternative Options Matrix
5. Self-Audit Summary
```

## SELF-EVALUATION UPGRADES
- Failure Simulation Test: "Would this definition handle {common_industry_error}?"
- Weighting Stress Test: "Do criteria weights reflect current {industry} priorities?"
- Recovery Protocol Check: "Can fallbacks handle 95% of last quarter's errors?"
