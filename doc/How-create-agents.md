This template defines not just what the agent should do, but how it should think, what criteria it should use for decisions, and what the output format should be.



## Implementation Recommendations

1. Create a template library focused on e-commerce metrics analysis with different complexity levels

2. Implement specialized abilities. E.g. for e-commerce platforms:
    Magento order analysis
    Customer segmentation
    Product performance evaluation
    Conversion funnel analysis

3. Add decision frameworks to your templates:
    ICE scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
    RICE prioritization (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)
    Pareto analysis (80/20 rule)

4. Incorporate industry benchmarks into your agent definitions to enable comparative analysis

5. Build feedback loops where the agent can evaluate the success of previous recommendations
